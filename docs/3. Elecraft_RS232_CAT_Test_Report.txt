RS232 ELECRAFT CAT TEST REPORT

1. DESCRIPTION OF TEST SETUP

Hardware:

-   ESP32 with MAX3232 RS232 level converter
-   DB9 connector on the custom PCB
-   External RS232-to-USB adapter connected to DB9
-   Second PC running CoolTerm
-   First PC running Arduino IDE Serial Monitor (USB connection)

Connections:

PC1 (USB) <-> ESP32 USB Serial (115200 baud) 
ESP32 UART2 <-> MAX3232 <-> DB9 <-> 
RS232-USB Adapter <-> PC2 (CoolTerm)

The ESP32 bridges between: - USB Serial (Arduino IDE) - Hardware UART
(RS232 side)

For this test, no real Elecraft radio was connected. CoolTerm simulated
the KX2/KX3 radio.

2. SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION

Arduino Serial Monitor: - 115200 baud - Used to send commands to ESP32

ESP32 RS232 Settings: PROTO ELE TXFMT ASCII BAUD 38400

CoolTerm: - 38400 baud - 8 data bits - No parity - 1 stop bit - No flow
control

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. TEST PROCEDURE

Step 1 – Frequency Request

Arduino sent: FA;

CoolTerm replied: FA00014074000;

Meaning: - FA; = Request VFO A frequency - FA00014074000; = 14.074000
MHz

Result: ESP32 correctly decoded the response and displayed: VFO A FREQ:
14.074000 MHz

Step 2 – Mode Request

Arduino sent: MD;

CoolTerm replied: MD2;

Meaning: - MD; = Request mode - MD2; = USB mode

Result: ESP32 correctly decoded and displayed: MODE: USB

Step 3 – Mode Set

Arduino sent: MD3;

CoolTerm replied: MD3;

Meaning: - MD3; = Set CW mode

Result: ESP32 confirmed and decoded: MODE: CW

Step 4 – PTT Control

Arduino sent: TX; CoolTerm replied: tx;

Meaning: - TX; = Transmit ON

Arduino sent: RX; CoolTerm replied: rx;

Meaning: - RX; = Return to Receive

Result: ESP32 correctly interpreted both commands and displayed: PTT: ON
PTT: OFF

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. DATA TRANSMISSION DETAILS

Example: 46 41 3B = “FA;” 4D 44 32 3B = “MD2;” 54 58 3B = “TX;”

0D 0A = Carriage Return + Line Feed (Enter key)

CoolTerm sends CR/LF when Enter is pressed. ESP32 receives and displays
these bytes as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. CONCLUSION

The test confirms:

-   RS232 transmission from ESP32 to PC works correctly.
-   RS232 reception from PC to ESP32 works correctly.
-   ASCII CAT command parsing works correctly.
-   Elecraft CAT decoding logic operates as expected.
-   Baudrate configuration is correct.
-   Hardware wiring and level conversion are correct.

The system is fully functional and ready for connection to a real
Elecraft KX2 or KX3 radio.
