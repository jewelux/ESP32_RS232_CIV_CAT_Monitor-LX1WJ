ELECRAFT KX2 / KX3 – CAT MINIMAL WORKING GUIDE

Confirmed setup requirements: 
- PROTO ELE 
- TXFMT ASCII 
- Correct CAT Baudrate (typically 38400 or 19200) 
- Each command must end with “;”

BASIC PRINCIPLES
------------------

Elecraft CAT uses pure ASCII commands.
There are: 
- No binary frames 
- No FE FE structure 
- No BCD format 
- No broadcast traffic
Each command ends with “;” and the radio replies with “;”

READ FREQUENCY
----------------
Command: FA;
Expected Reply Example: FA00014033000;
Meaning: - 11 digits - Frequency in Hz - Leading zeros included
Example: FA00014033000; = 14.033.000 MHz

READ MODE
-----------
Command: MD;
Expected Reply Example: MD2;
Mode Codes: 1 = LSB 2 = USB 3 = CW 4 = FM 5 = AM 6 = DATA 7 = CW-REV 9 =
DATA-REV

SET MODE
----------
Example – Set USB: MD2;
Expected Reply: MD2;

SET FREQUENCY
---------------
Example – Set 14.060.000 MHz: FA00014060000;
Expected Reply: FA00014060000;

PTT CONTROL
-------------
PTT ON: TX;
PTT OFF: RX;
The sketch will display: ELE: TX; -> PTT=ON ELE: RX; -> PTT=OFF

MINIMAL DAILY TEST SEQUENCE
-----------------------------
Enter exactly the following commands:
PROTO ELE TXFMT ASCII BAUD 38400
FA; MD; MD2; TX; RX;
Expected behavior:
-   FA; -> radio returns current frequency
-   MD; -> radio returns current mode
-   MD2; -> mode changes to USB
-   TX; -> PTT ON
-   RX; -> PTT OFF
If no reply: - Check baudrate - Check CAT enabled in radio menu - Check
RS232 wiring (RX/TX not swapped) - Check flow control disabled
